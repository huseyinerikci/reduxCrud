# Redux CRUD Project
This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application developed using React, Redux, Bootstrap and JSON-Server. Data is retrieved from the JSON file with the API and updating, deleting and completing operations are performed on the data with the buttons on the screen. The application also has an input field that allows users to add data to the screen.
